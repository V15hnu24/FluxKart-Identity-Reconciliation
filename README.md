# FluxKart-Identity-Reconciliation


Task overiew:
Meet the brilliant yet eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown, better known as Doc. Hopelessly stuck in 2023, he is fixing his time machine to go back to the future and save his friend. His favourite online store FluxKart.com sells all the parts required to build this contraption. As crazy as he might get at times, Doc surely knows how to be careful. To avoid drawing attention to his grandiose project, Doc is using different email addresses and phone numbers for each purchase.

FluxKart.com is deadpan serious about their customer experience. There is nothing more important than rewarding their loyal customers and giving a personalised experience. To do this, FluxKart decides to integrate a system into their platform. System collects contact details from shoppers for a personalised customer experience. 

This project is to implement the system.


## Features

- **Contact Identification**: Identify contacts based on email or phone number.
